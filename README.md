# StarWars DB

This was originally a test set for JLP, which I have since dropped into a fresh instance of Vite to continue building out.

:heavy_check_mark: Code in pure React / TypeScript

:heavy_check_mark: No jQuery

## Original specs

More can be built out here as per the original specs of the test listed below.

### Brief

Your task is to create a website that will allow customers to see the range of dishwashers John Lewis sells. This app will be a simple to use and will make use of existing John Lewis APIs.

We have started the project, but we'd like you to finish it off to a production-ready standard.

#### Product Grid

When the website is launched, the customer will be presented with a grid of dishwashers that are currently available for customers to buy.

For this exercise we’d be looking at only displaying the first 20 results returned by the API.

#### Product Page

When a dishwasher is clicked, a new screen is displayed showing the dishwasher’s details.

#### Designs

In the `/designs` folder you will find 3 images that show the desired screen layout for the app

- product-page-portrait.png
- product-page-landscape.png
- product-grid.png

### Things we're looking for

- The website should be fully responsive, working across device sizes. We've provided you with some ipad-sized images as a guide.
- The use of third party code/SDKs is allowed, but you should be able to explain why you have chosen the third party code.
- We’d like to see a TDD approach to writing the app, we've included a Jest setup or you can use your preferred option.
- Put all your assumptions, notes and instructions into your GitHub README.md.
- We’re looking for a solution that's as close to the designs as possible.
- We'll be assessing your coding style, how you've approached this task and whether you've met quality standards on areas such as accessibility, security and performance.
- You shouldn't spend more than 3 hours on this task.

## Available Scripts

In the root directory you can run:

### `npm install`

Will perform a usual installation of any dependencies.

### `npm run dev`

Will perform a usual launch of the dev environment.

### `npm run test`

Will perform a launch of the test suite; generating a fully 100% covered report.

## NOTE1:

As this is a Vite app, I installed Jest unit-tests using:

## NOTE2:

As this is a Vite app, I hosted it on GitHub pages using this guide:
